    "# Word Count with MapReduce - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in Spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will read a text corpus into the Spark environment, perform a word count, and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply the map(func) transformation to a given function on all elements of an RDD in different partitions \n",
    "- Apply a map transformation for all elements of an RDD \n",
    "- Compare the difference between a transformation and an action within RDDs \n",
    "- Use collect(), count(), and take() actions to trigger spark transformations \n",
    "- Use filter to select data that meets certain specifications within an RDD \n",
    "- Use Spark and the MapReduce framework to complete a full parallelized word count problem \n",
    "\n",
    "## MapReduce task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our problem looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have a huge text document\n",
    "* We need to count the number of times each distinct word appears in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Analyze web server logs to find popular URLs\n",
    "    * Analyze texts for content or style "

    "## Word Count\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate a MapReduce computation for counting the number of occurrences for each word in a text corpus. In this example, the input file is a repository of documents and each document is an element. We shall count the frequency of stop words for __style identification__ as stop words might have unique features which can potentially describe the author's writing style based on their use of stop words while writing. We shall look at some texts by Shakespeare and Jane Austin following this motivation. \n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce in PySpark provides a practical and efficient way of achieving this goal as it: \n",
    "\n",
    "* works if the file is too large for memory\n",
    "\n",
    "* works even if the output is too large for memory\n",
    "\n",

    "In this simple exercise, we saw MapReduce in action for solving a basic NLP task, i.e. counting the frequency of stop words and keep words of a text corpus. This exercise can be seen as a first step towards text analytics on big data platforms. After this lab, we will get into more advanced use cases of PySpark, specifically for machine learning applications. "
